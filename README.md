# SMALL DISCRIPTION OF THE TEXT SUMMARIZATION TOOL :

A text summarization tool is a software application designed to automatically condense large pieces of text into shorter, meaningful summaries without losing the core information. It uses techniques from natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to identify and extract the most important points from the input text. Summarization tools can be extractive (picking key sentences directly) or abstractive (generating new phrases to capture the main ideas). These tools are widely used to save time, improve information digestion, and assist in tasks like reading research papers, news articles, reports, or any lengthy documents.
